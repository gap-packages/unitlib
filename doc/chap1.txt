  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YGeneral aims[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XKG[122X  be  a  group  algebra  of  a  finite  [22Xp[122X-group [22XG[122X over the field [22XK[122X of
  characteristic  [22Xp[122X,  and  let  [22XV(KG)[122X  be the normalized unit group of [22XKG[122X. The
  pc-presentation  of  the  group  [22XV(KG)[122X can be computed using the [5XGAP[105X package
  [5XLAGUNA[105X ([7Xhttps://gap-packages.github.io/laguna/[107X), but for groups of orders 64
  and more such computation will already take a lot of time.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XUnitLib[105X package is an extension of the [5XLAGUNA[105X package that is focused on
  this  problem.  It contains the library of normalized unit groups of modular
  group  algebras of finite [22Xp[122X-groups over the field of [22Xp[122X elements. This allows
  the  user to retrieve the pre-computed group from the library instead of the
  time-consuming  computation.  The  group  created with [5XUnitLib[105X will have the
  same properties and attributes as the one computed with [5XLAGUNA[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  version  [5XUnitLib[105X  3.0.0  released in May 2009 also contained a parallel
  implementation  of the computation of the normalized unit group of a modular
  group  algebra of a finite [22Xp[122X-group over the field of [22Xp[122X elements, which works
  for groups from the [5XGAP[105X small groups library. It is developed on the base of
  the  sequential  version of this algorithm (which works for any [22Xp[122X-group with
  no  limitations)  from  the  [5XLAGUNA[105X  package. Parallelisation is implemented
  using  the  [5XSCSCP[105X  package  that  is  capable of connecting several local or
  remote [5XGAP[105X instances using the [5XSCSCP[105X protocol.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn April 2012, [5XUnitLib[105X 3.1.0 was updated to comply with [5XGAP[105X 4.5.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  current  version  of  [5XUnitLib[105X  provides  the library of normalized unit
  groups  [22XV(KG)[122X  for  all  [22Xp[122X-groups  of  order  less  than  243 in the package
  distribution. The data for order 243 is available as an optional download.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  need  to  work  with  groups  of bigger orders, please write to the
  maintainers, because they may be already computed or we can compute them for
  you.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YTheoretical background[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSince  the  [5XUnitLib[105X package is an extension of the [5XLAGUNA[105X package [BKRS], we
  refer to the [14XLAGUNA: LAGUNA package[114X manual for the theoretical backround. In
  particular,  Chapter  3  (The  basic  theory  behind  [5XLAGUNA[105X) of that manual
  contains  definitions  of  the modular group algebra and its normalized unit
  group, the power-commutator presentation of the group, and also more details
  about  the  algorithm  for  the  computation  of  the pc-presentation of the
  normalized unit group of a modular group algebra of a finite [22Xp[122X-group.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YInstallation and system requirements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XUnitLib[105X  4.1.0  requires at least [5XGAP[105X 4.10. The libraries of normalized unit
  groups  of  groups of orders less than 243 are included in the distribution.
  The data for order 243 is available as an optional download.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBecause the [5XUnitLib[105X is an extension of the [5XLAGUNA[105X package, you must have the
  [5XLAGUNA[105X  package  installed.  You can obtain it from the [5XGAP[105X homepage or from
  its homepage [7Xhttps://gap-packages.github.io/laguna/[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  use  the [5XUnitLib[105X online help it is necessary to install the [5XGAP[105X4 package
  [5XGAPDoc[105X  by  Frank L√ºbeck and Max Neunh√∂ffer, which is available from the [5XGAP[105X
  homepage or from [7Xhttp://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XUnitLib[105X is distributed in standard formats ([11Xtar.gz[111X, [11Xtar.bz2[111X, [11X.zip[111X, [11X-win.zip[111X)
  and    can    be    obtained    from    the    [5XGAP[105X    homepage    or    from
  [7Xhttps://gap-packages.github.io/unitlib/[107X.  To  install  [5XUnitLib[105X,  unpack  its
  archive  into  the [11Xpkg[111X subdirectory of your [5XGAP[105X installation. When you don't
  have  access  to  the  directory of your main [5XGAP[105X installation, you can also
  install  the package [13Xoutside the [5XGAP[105X main directory[113X by unpacking it inside a
  directory [11XMYGAPDIR/pkg[111X. Then to be able to load [5XUnitLib[105X you need to call [5XGAP[105X
  with the [10X-l ";MYGAPDIR"[110X option.[133X
